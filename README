Contact form that validates on server-side via AJAX call
========================================================

Makes use of:
  - AJAX by way of JavaScript + JQuery
  - OO PHP, using classes to help render the form and validate the data
  - HTML/CSS to structure, layout and style the form

Simplified for demonstration. 

A real website would use a front controller rather than a page controller that 
would provide a single point of access and handle both regular and AJAX 
based requests.
